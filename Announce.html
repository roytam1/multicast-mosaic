<H2>
  The W3C Track at WWW7
</H2>
<P>
The executive management and select technical staff members of the
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</A> will be
at <A HREF="http://www7.conf.au/">WWW7</A> to present the sole "Annual Report"
to the broader Web community on the history, overview, accomplishments and
next steps of key activities within the Consortium's four technical Domains:
Architecture, User Interface, Technology &amp; Society, and the Web Accessibility
Initiative.
<P>
Tim Berners-Lee, W3C Director and inventor of the World Wide Web, will
&nbsp;deliver WWW7's opening keynote speech and kickoff the three-day W3C
Track. As in past WWW conferences, following each presentation will be a
panel discussion with W3C staff, working group chairs, and invited industry
experts. Following the positive response at last year's WWW6 conference,
the W3C Track will close with a "Town Hall" session with W3C executive
management, allowing the community to offer feedback on W3C's direction and
representation.
<P>
Confirmed W3C representatives participating at WWW7 include members of the
technical staff, visiting engineers from W3C Member organizations, &nbsp;and
management. In addition to Tim Berners-Lee, the executive management includes
Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Abramatic, Chairman; Nobuo Saito, Associate Chairman;
Alan Kotok, Associate Chairman and Acting Technology &amp; Society Domain
Leader; Vincent Quint, Deputy Director for Europe and User Interface Domain
Leader; Tatsuya Hagino, Deputy Director for Asia; Judy Brewer, Director of
the Web Accessibility Initiative International Program Office; Dan Connolly,
Architecture Domain Leader; and Sally Khudairi, Head of Communications.
<P>
Leading the World Wide Web to its full potential, the W3C was created to
develop common protocols that enhance the interoperability and promote the
evolution of the Web. It is an international industry consortium jointly
run by the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS) in the USA, the National
Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control (INRIA) in France
and Keio University in Japan. Services provided by the Consortium include:
a repository of information about the World Wide Web for developers and users;
reference code implementations to embody and promote standards; and various
prototype and sample applications to demonstrate use of new technology. To
date, over 235 organizations are Members of the Consortium.
