** -------------------------------------------------------------
**  File containing routines to convert a buffer
**  of bytes to/from RFC 1113 printable encoding format.
**
**  This technique is similar to the familiar Unix uuencode
**  format in that it maps 6 binary bits to one ASCII
**  character (or more aptly, 3 binary bytes to 4 ASCII
**  characters).  However, RFC 1113 does not use the same
**  mapping to printable characters as uuencode.

/*--- function HTUU_encode -----------------------------------------------
 *
 *   Encode a single line of binary data to a standard format that
 *   uses only printing ASCII characters (but takes up 33% more bytes).
 *
 *    Entry    bufin    points to a buffer of bytes.  If nbytes is not
 *                      a multiple of three, then the byte just beyond
 *                      the last byte in the buffer must be 0.
 *             nbytes   is the number of bytes in that buffer.
 *                      This cannot be more than 48.
 *             bufcoded points to an output buffer.  Be sure that this
 *                      can hold at least 1 + (4*nbytes)/3 characters.
 *
 *    Exit     bufcoded contains the coded line.  The first 4*nbytes/3 bytes
 *                      contain printing ASCII characters representing
 *                      those binary bytes. This may include one or
 *                      two '=' characters used as padding at the end.
 *                      The last byte is a zero byte.
 *             Returns the number of ASCII characters in "bufcoded".

 *                         enough to hold the decoded string (generally
 *                         shorter than the encoded string) plus
 *                         as many as two extra bytes used during
 *                         the decoding process.
 *             outbufsize  is the maximum number of bytes that
 *                         can fit in bufplain.
 *
 *    Exit     Returns the number of binary bytes decoded.
