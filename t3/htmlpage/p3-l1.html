<H2>Topic: Multicasting from the International World Wide Web Conferences,
Past and Present</H2>

<HR>

<P>
Evolving from a purely academic event,the International WWW Conference has developed into a get-together of thousands of users from a wide variety of application domains.
MBONE multicasting from International WWW Conferences has also changed from an occasional
test multicasting to the event that is fully integrated into the Conference. One
cannot even imagine the WWW Conference without multicasting.<br><p>
MBONE multicasting has been organised at each WWW Conference.
The complexity and the material multicast has grown with each conference
At the first Conference only occasional sessions were multicasted.
At the second conference in Chicago, one MBONE machine was used from the begining to the end.
At the 3rd and 4th conferences two parallel streams has been organized.
In Paris we are multicasting on two channels.
Multicasting from the conferences is also used as a testbed for the new
tools. In Darmstadt we used webcast for multicasting html slides. In Paris
we are using mcm for this purpose. In Boston reliable audio tool (rat)
was used as an alternative to visual audio tool (vat).For the first time, at this Conference we are 
sending audio and video stream for PC/mac over  a Cu-SeeMe reflector in
Norway. A subset of sessions that were multicast were recorded on the video tape. These tapes were rebroadcast the same day for the another hemisphere on the
Third and Fourth conference. Some  sessions from the Third conference are available as audio/video/slides on demand.<p>
This panel, along with other events will lead to integration processes between
IETF activities, WWW Consortium and all the progressive people in the world
in building the global information system.
<h3>Personnel engaged to support multicasting </h3>

The Future of MBONE multicasting from International WWW Conferences should be:
<UL>
<LI>To broadcast the Conference globally
<LI>To organise the WWW conference on demand after the conference is over
