<H2>Topic: Introduction to the Panel, Guidelines for Participation</H2>

<HR>

<P>
This panel is an experiment in applying the technology it discusses.
The two co-chairs and three of the eight panelists will be sitting
in the conference hall in Paris,
but the remaining 5 panelists will attempt to participate
using MBONE-based teleconferencing tools over the Internet
from several sites in California.
If the MBONE performs as hoped, remote panelists will be able to
not only receive audio and video from the conference center,
but to transmit audio/video back to Paris.
As a further experiment, we will be using a new system for multicasting
Web documents,
and will be using this to transmit the Web displays that are being projected
in the conference room to remote participants.
As a technical backup,
we will have in place a telephone conference call to the remote panelists,
to allow audio exchanges.
</P>

<P>
As with telephony in its early days,
Internet-based teleconferencing technology lacks a set of widely shared
social conventions that would integrate it smoothly into current modes
of behavior at conferences.
My tasks as co-chair will be to ensure that the panel stays on schedule,
that the panel collectively addresses the promised topics
(there is much interesting material to discuss),
and that we experience smooth interactions between
remote and local panelists,
and between all panelists and remote and local attendees.
